                            <p>Meadow Drugs and Surgical is a local drug store in my hometown and was my first job. My job, besides
                                cashier, was to stock shelves and clean the store throughout the day, as well as organize the basement.
                                <br><br>
                                This was my first real job where I was paid hourly, and it taught me how to interact with people in a polite
                                manner and have a conversation with customers while they waited for their prescriptions, regardless of how we
                                were treated.

                            <p>National Archives was a job I was offered to work throughout the summer between Freshman ad Sophomore year of college.
                                My primary job here was to move boxes around the warehouse and go on deliveries to customers requesting files
                                and boxes as well as picking up from customers.
                                <br><br>
                                This job consisted of less communication with the public, but gave me the opportunity to connect with coworkers more,
                                begin to develop strategies on how to work faster and efficiently. It also taught me how to take care of myself, and if
                                I neede help, to ask for it, because you can't do everything alone, and others are there to help.

                            <p>Being a Teacher's Assistant requires me to interact with peers and other students on a day to day basis and help explain
                                concepts and techniques to those who don't understand what to do or to help others advance when they have grasped and understood
                                how and when to use different skills. I am in charge of this as well as grading for the class. Quite simply, I am a teacher's assistant.
                                <br><br>
                                I am learning as a TA how to manage my time so that I have time to grade work, but also how to teach and be clear on what I am trying to
                                explain. If a student is struggling, I have to be clear on how to use specific software and what to do. I'm really enjoying it, and it's really
                                teaching me how to be a better leader.
